		<string>Rett syndrome is a unique postnatal neurological disorder that is rst recognized in infancy and
seen almost always in girls, but can be rarely seen in boys.
Rett syndrome has been most often misdiagnosed as autism, cerebral palsy, or non-specic
developmental delay
Rett syndrome is caused by mutations on the X chromosome on a gene called MECP2. There
are more than 200 dierent mutations found on the MECP2 gene. Most of these mutations
are found in eight dierent “hot spots.”
Rett syndrome strikes all racial and ethnic groups, and occurs worldwide in 1 of every 10,000
female births.
Rett syndrome is a postnatal neurological disorder. It is not a degenerative disorder.
Rett syndrome causes problems in brain function that are responsible for cognitive, sensory,
emotional, motor and autonomic function. These can include learning, speech, sensory
sensations, mood, movement, breathing, cardiac function, and even chewing, swallowing,
and digestion.  Reference: https://www.rettsyndrome.org/document.doc?id=168</string>
